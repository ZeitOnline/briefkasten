Setup on Beagle Bone:

Follow the guide according to https://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/arm/BeagleBoneBlack and install a recent FreeBSD, e.g. from

https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/ISO-IMAGES/12.0/FreeBSD-12.0-RELEASE-arm-armv7-BEAGLEBONE.img.xz

Install ezjail, python2.7 in host system and configure your IP addresses.

Don't deploy pkg.conf to the jails, as they dont work from amd64 packets. Add a proper resolv.conf and localtime to your templates.

If you ever encounter deployment issues during lxml builds, you might have to manually log into the jails and 'pip install lxml' in the respective venvs. YMMV.

no distribution packages for arm7
ezjail installs from source
pkg quarterly is there
make pkg-zeit build for arm7

Several variables not set nor explained:
ansible-pf_map_interface = cpsw0
ansible-ploy_post_secret = FoHyethJas

local theme path not relative to Makefile:
local_theme_path = ../../application/themes/default/


lxml doesn't build on low memory
use python-pkg for lxml?

python-gnupg needs 0.4.4
watchdog needs 0.8.0
