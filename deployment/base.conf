# archive configuration
#
# submissions above a given size can optionally not be sent via email

# including a formatted link via which they can then access the actual files
# which have been archived in a single zip archive and PGP encrypted for the
# editors.
#
# the maxiumum size that the attachments of a drop may reach and
# still be attached to the notification email
# drops with larger attachments will contain a link to the encrypted archive
# instead
attachment_size_threshold = 1Gb

# the format is a simple python string with a single placeholder for the drop's id
# and MUST end with `.zip.pgp`
# it is up to the administrator of the system to make sure that this URL works,
# possible solutions include HTTP access, SFTP, SMB etc.

# the number of seconds that cleansing is allowed to take after which the cleanser will
# be terminated and the cleansing will be considered to have failed
cleanser_timeout_secs = 180
#
# IMPORTANT: once a format url is defined and the size exceeds the threshold
# the system will deposit drops permanently in the filesystem inside a separate
# toplevel folder of the dropnox named `archive_cleansed`.
#
# by default the directory of the archive is located inside the drop root directory
# however, since this is mounted into the worker jail via nullfs, once cannot (easily) mount
# network shares or other devices. in this case you can override the location and let it point
# to a directory inside the jail, i.e. if you mount an CIFS share on the jail host into
# /usr/jails/worker/mnt/cleansed_archive then you would set the location as follows:
# dropbox_cleansed_archive_path = /mnt/cleansed_archive
# 
# additionally another format can be defined, if present it will cause submissions
# whose cleansing has failed to be archived in their original, uncleansed state
# albeit encrypted.

# dropbox_failed_archive_url_format = https://somehost.com/dirty_drops/%s.zip.pgp

# dropbox_failed_archive_path = /mnt/failed_archive
